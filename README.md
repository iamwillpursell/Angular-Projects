# Angular-Projects
This repository contains all of my projects related to Angular. These projects are just for fun and are used to explore the wide range of features that Angular has to offer. Within each project, you will find varying difficulties of code because of my curiosity and journey as I learn to successfully implement Angular into ideas. Feel free to take a look inside or copy any of these projects to promote your own learning.
